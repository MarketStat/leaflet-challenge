# leaflet-challenge

**Purpose**

The purpose of these files is to demonstrate knowledge of leaflet, combining USGS data and information of tectonic plates to provide a map with interactive markets detailing locations of earthquakes around the world. D3, leaflet and HTML were used to create this map including a legend with multiple types of maps (including use of the Mapbox API to provide a satellite view. 

**Note**

ChatGPT was used to resolve several errors, as well as USGS documentation (used for testing on daily, weekly data), as well as several Stack Overflow forums to learn more about creating the legend and recommendations for the satellite layer (Mapbox).
